# Lazy-Luke

###Lazy-Luke is a lazy font loading module programmed in JavaScript. It is small, easy to implement and has an extreme low Google Pagespeed impact (instead of conventional loading methods).

Works like a charme for: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE9+, iOS 7+, Android 4+

Handles also cross domain security errors with conventional fallbacks.
